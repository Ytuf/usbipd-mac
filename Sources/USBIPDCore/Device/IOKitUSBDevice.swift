///   processor leads with a CDC-ACM control interface, which AppleUSBACMControl keeps, so
///   the client's very first GET_DESCRIPTOR failed with kIOReturnExclusiveAccess.
/// - Endpoints on any other interface did not exist. A multi-target CMSIS-DAP probe
///   served its first target and returned "No pipe for endpoint" for the rest.
/// - A failed interface open leaked the device open that preceded it, because close()
///   only undid a fully successful open. The device then stayed held exclusively and
///   every retry failed at USBDeviceOpen instead.
///
/// Now the session opens every interface macOS lets go of and routes each endpoint to
/// its owner. Control requests go to the device's default pipe, which needs no
/// interface: IOKit forwards a class request addressed to an interface this process
/// does not own, so a client can set a held CDC port's line coding and DTR — measured
/// against AppleUSBACMControl on a FreeWili 2 and its RP2040 probe. Endpoints of the
